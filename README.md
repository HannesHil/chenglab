## Overview

- These are the configurations for my homelab servers, desktop, and M1 MacBook
  Air
- Nix flakes handle upstream dependencies
- [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) manages my
  dotfiles
- [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) manages my MacBook
- [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) manages secrets such as my
  Tailscale authentication key
- `justfile` contains useful aliases for many frequent and atrociously long nix
  commands
- Modular architecture promotes readability for me and copy-and-paste-ability
  for you

## Getting set up 

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eh8/chenglab/main/install.sh)"
```

On macOS, this will prompt you to install `nix` onto your local machine if you
don't already use it. I prefer the [Determine Nix
installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install). On Linux, it will prepare
your system by partitioning drives and mounting them.

> [!WARNING] These configuration files are tailored for me. Be sure to carefully
> examine this repository if you deploy onto your own machines.

## Useful commands

Install `just` to access the simple aliases below

### Locally deploy changes

```
just deploy macos
```

```
just deploy MACHINE
```

### Remote deployment

To remotely deploy `MACHINE`, which has an IP address of `10.0.10.2`

```
just deploy MACHINE 10.0.10.2
```

### Edit secrets

To modify `secrets/secrets.yaml`. Make sure each device public key is listed as
entry in `.sops.yaml`.

```
just secrets
```

## Important caveats

### Changing user passwords

To modify user password, first generate a hash

```
echo "password" | mkpasswd -m SHA-512 -s
```

Then run `just secrets` to replace the existing decrypted hash with the one that
you just generated. If you use a password manager, sure to update the new
password as necessary.

### Changing SSH keys

Make sure you update the public key as it appears across the repository.

### Installation source

Make sure the Determinate Nix installer one-liner in `install.sh` is consistent
with how it appears on the official website.
