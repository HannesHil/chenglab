# Homelab

## Step 0: Computing Project Structure

To create a NixOS flake system for a homelab with the described features, we need to consider the structure of a NixOS flake project. Here's a breakdown of the files we'll need:

1. `flake.nix`: This is the entry point of the Nix flake. It will define the project's dependencies, outputs, and NixOS system configuration. It should be created first as it sets up the overall structure.
2. `flake.lock`: This file will be automatically generated when you build or update the flake to pin the exact versions of the dependencies. It's important for reproducibility.
3. `configuration.nix`: This is the main configuration file for the NixOS system. It will include the base set of configurations, such as setting up zram, ssh with authorized keys, and unlocking the LUKS encrypted hard drive.
4. `hardware-configuration.nix`: This file is typically auto-generated during the NixOS installation, but we may need to edit it to add configurations specific to the hardware, like the additional LUKS encrypted hard drive.
5. `users/eh8.nix`: This file will contain the user-specific configuration for the user "eh8".
6. `modules/jellyfin.nix`: This module will contain the configuration needed to enable the Jellyfin service.
7. `modules/nextcloud.nix`: Similarly, this module will contain the configuration for the Nextcloud service.
8. `modules/nextdns.nix`: This module will contain the configuration for the NextDNS service.
9. `modules/docker-homebridge.nix`: This module will contain the configuration for running Homebridge in a Docker container.
10. `modules/common-services.nix`: This file can be used to import and enable common services that are shared across different modules.
11. `secrets/luks-keyfile`: This would be the keyfile used to unlock the additional LUKS encrypted hard drive. It should be stored securely and probably not checked into version control.
12. `secrets/ssh-authorized-keys`: This file will contain the SSH public keys that are authorized to access the system.

The order of creation should be such that the `flake.nix` is created first, followed by the main configuration files, then the user configurations, and finally the service modules. The secrets should be handled securely and are typically not part of the version-controlled files, but I've included them in the list for completeness.

Now, let's call the function with the filenames in the order that they should be created:

```json
[
  "flake.nix",
  "configuration.nix",
  "hardware-configuration.nix",
  "users/eh8.nix",
  "modules/common-services.nix",
  "modules/jellyfin.nix",
  "modules/nextcloud.nix",
  "modules/nextdns.nix",
  "modules/docker-homebridge.nix",
  "secrets/luks-keyfile",
  "secrets/ssh-authorized-keys"
]
```

Let's call the function with this array:

```json
{
  "fileNames": [
    "flake.nix",
    "configuration.nix",
    "hardware-configuration.nix",
    "users/eh8.nix",
    "modules/common-services.nix",
    "modules/jellyfin.nix",
    "modules/nextcloud.nix",
    "modules/nextdns.nix",
    "modules/docker-homebridge.nix",
    "secrets/luks-keyfile",
    "secrets/ssh-authorized-keys"
  ]
}
```

As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate actual secret keys or binary content, which would be required for a LUKS keyfile. However, I can guide you on how to create a LUKS keyfile on a Unix-like system.

To create a LUKS keyfile, you would typically use the `dd` command to generate a file with random data that can be used as a keyfile for LUKS encryption. Here's an example of how you might create a keyfile:

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/path/to/secrets/luks-keyfile bs=512 count=4
```

This command will create a file with 2048 bytes (512 bytes * 4) of random data from `/dev/urandom`, which is a good source of random data on Unix-like
